# STM32F4HUB
Add USB Hub support to your STM32F4 project. Based on STM32Cube Library

* Support to Full speed and low speed usb devices through a hub. 
* Support to all hid interfaces.
* Easilly portable to others STM32Fx microcontrollers

* Ready to be opened and compiled with AC6 IDE

It's ready to run on a STM32F4DISCOVERY development board. You just need a Micro-AB to Type A usb cable.
